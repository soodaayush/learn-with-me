            I am a tutor. I am a person that loves to teach children. I have
            always loved teaching and guiding children to their dreams. I always
            loved children's creativity, what they think, their opinions on
            certain topics. I have been teaching for a long time

          <p>
            My teaching space is a space for students to socialize, collaberate,
            become friends, etc. I have a lot of experience of teaching
            children. I have been doing that for 15 years. I love teaching kids
            and making them understand what's wrong and what's right. If you
            want me to teach your kids I will make sure I will guide them to
            success. I will make sure that your children will get teachings that
            are worth your money.
