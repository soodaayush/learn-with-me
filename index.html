          <p>
            I am a tutor. I am a person that loves to teach children and guide
            them towards their dreams. I always loved children's creativity,
            what they think, and their opinions on certain topics. I have been
            teaching for a long time and will continue to teach for the rest of
            my life.

          <p>
            My teaching space is a space for students to socialize, collaborate,
            become friends, etc. I have 15 years of experience teaching
            children. I love teaching kids and making them understand what's
            wrong and what's right. If you want me to teach your kids I will
            make sure I will guide them to success.
