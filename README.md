## Inspiration

I created this website for a relative of mine who is a tutor, providing an easier way to gather information about their services and register for them.

## Challenges

Ensuring the website performed well despite the number of large images being rendered.

## Lessons Learned

I learned about Sass and its features that CSS doesn't have. I also learned about handling form input submissions.

## The Website

This website allows users to gather information about the tutor's services and contact them.
