## Inspiration

I created this site for a relative who works as a tutor. The goal was to provide a clean, user-friendly way for families to learn about available services and sign up easily.

## Challenges

- Optimizing performance while displaying multiple high-resolution images
- Ensuring a smooth and accessible user experience across devices

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me explore:

- Sass: Using variables, nesting, and mixins for cleaner and more maintainable styles
- Forms: Handling input fields and preparing submissions for integration with backend services

## The Website

A simple and effective tutoring website built to showcase services and streamline student registration.
