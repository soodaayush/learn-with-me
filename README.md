## Inspiration

I created this website for a relative of mine who is a tutor as an easier way of gathering information about their services and registering for them.

## Challenges

Making sure the performance of the website ran well, due to the number of large images being rendered.

## Lessons Learned

Learned about Sass and the features that CSS doesn't have. I learned about handling form input submissions.

## The Website

This website allows you to gather information about the tutor's services and allows you to contact them.
